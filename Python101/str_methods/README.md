# str.lower() Method
The "str.lower()" method is a built-in Python string method used to convert all characters in a string to lowercase. This method does not take any parameters. The method returns a new string where all uppercase characters in the original string are converted to lowercase.
The method scans each character in the string. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to its lowercase equivalent.Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
N.B. The original string is not modified. Instead, a new string is returned with all characters converted to lowercase.
