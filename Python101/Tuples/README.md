# Tuple Methods
Tuples have only two built-in methods, this is mostly because tuples are immutable, meaninig they cannot be changed after creation. But they support many other operations like indexing, slicing, and iteration.
The two built-in methods are count() and index()
# tup.count(value)
Like the name suggests it returns the ammount of vaulues or the number of times a value appears in the tuple.
# tup.index(value)
Returns the first index where the value is found or it's first occurance. Raises ValueError if missing.
