# Sets 
Sets are python data type used to store unique, unordered collections of data. They are similar to mathematical sets and support operations like union, intersection, and difference.

# Set Methods
# set.add()
This set method is used to add a single item or an element (that is placed in the parenthesis) in to the set. It will modify the set with the added item.

# set.difference()
This method creates a new set then returns the new set containing elements in the original set but not in the others. Keep in mind that this method accepts multiple sets as arguments and  the original sets remain unchanged.

# set.difference_update()
Unlike the difference() method this method doesn't make a new set, rather it will modify the original set by removing the items that are presented in the other set.
